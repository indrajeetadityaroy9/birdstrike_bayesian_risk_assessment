## Vehicle Position
The true position of the vehicle in 2D space is denoted as \([x_T, y_T]^T\).

## Landmarks
The model considers K reference coordinates, represented as \{\([x_1, y_1]^T\), ..., \([x_K, y_K]^T\)\}.

## Range Measurements
Range measurements are denoted as \(r_i = d_{T_i} + n_i\) for each landmark \(i\), where \(d_{T_i}\) is the true distance to the ith landmark, and \(n_i\) is the measurement noise. The noise follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and known variance \(\sigma_i^2\).

## Prior Knowledge
The model incorporates prior knowledge about the vehicle's position. This is expressed in a probabilistic form involving the variances \(\sigma_x^2\) and \(\sigma_y^2\).

## Code Description
The code implements a Bayesian approach to the vehicle localization problem by combining prior knowledge about the vehicle's position with noisy distance measurements from \(K\) landmarks.

### Distance Measurement Model \((r_i = d_{Ti} + n_i)\)
- The `calculate_distance` function computes the true Euclidean distance \(d_{Ti}\) between the vehicle's estimated position \(`vehicle_x`, `vehicle_y`\) and each landmark \(`landmarks_x[k]`, `landmarks_y[k]`\).
- For each landmark, distance measurements are generated by adding Gaussian noise \(n_i\) (zero mean and known variance \(\sigma^2\)) to the true distance, resulting in the simulated distance measurement \(r_i = d_{Ti} + n_i\).

### Vehicle Position Prior Knowledge
- The prior knowledge is encapsulated in the `compute_map_objective` function. The prior probability \(p(\['vehicle_x', 'vehicle_y'\]^T)\) is represented as a Gaussian distribution with known variances \(\sigma_x^2\) and \(\sigma_y^2\).
- The `prior` is calculated as \(\frac{'vehicle_x'^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{'vehicle_y'^2}{\sigma_y^2}\), corresponding to the exponent part of the Gaussian distribution for the vehicle's position, after simplifying the expression.

### MAP Estimation
- The `compute_map_objective` function evaluates the objective function for MAP estimation by summing the prior and the likelihood of the measurements.
- The likelihood is computed as the sum of the squared differences between measured distances \(r_i\) and true distances \(d_{Ti}\), scaled by the measurement noise variance \(\sigma^2\).

### Optimization to Find MAP Estimate
- The `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module is used to find the vehicle's position that minimizes the MAP objective function, effectively maximizing the posterior probability of the estimated position given the measurements and the prior.
